			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Equip Skills</h3>

					<p>
						Prior to joining a match, you will have to select one of your reveries. This selection determines which skills will be available to you for the entire match. Upon loading in, you will then be randomly given four skills from your reverie which can be reshuffled for a potentially better starting set. 
					</p>

					<p>
						As you play, additional skills will become available. These can be used to overwrite a currently equipped skill to adapt your play style for synergizing with your allies or to better combat the opposing team.
					</p>

					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Harvest Resources</h3>

					<p>
						Throughout the map, remnants of fallen psyphers can be found in the space between each WOMP landing site. In addition, as players inevitably fall against opposing forces, one of these remnants will coalesce. Siphon the stabilizing energy to boost your maximum mana.
					</p>

					<p>
						A fusion of ancient technology and volatile energy can be found opposite from the first WOMP. Beware, this relic has drawn the attention of the local creatures and more simple-minded denizens. They must be removed from the area before you can claim the valuable restorative effects.
					</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="flex-row">
				<div class="col-sm-6">
					<h3>Claim Victory</h3>

					<p>
						Each match contains three WOMPs, powerful founts of energy that any psypher can tap into. Each WOMP a team captures guarantees that one-third of the final WOMP will be automatically secured for them. 
					</p>

					<p>
						The first will land at a neutral location, providing equal opportunity for both teams. The team that manages to harvest this WOMP will be that much closer to victory. Fret not if you fail to capture the first, as the second WOMP will land closer to the currently losing team. This gives a chance to balance the odds before the third and final WOMP spawns in the center of the map. 
					</p>

					<p>
						When a team harvests the third and final WOMP, the match is over and they are victorious.

			<h2 class="text-right text-upper"><strong>Gameplay Tips</strong></h2>

			<ul>
				<li>Combo those skills. One-offs are great, but a series of follow-ups will really turn the tide of a fight.</li>
				<li>Keep those trigger fingers twitch'n. Get a shot in before they can react, but make sure to raise that defense to block incoming attacks too.</li>
				<li>WOMPs capture faster with teammates. Stick together and that objective is practically yours.</li>
				<li>Skills need mana. Stronger skills need even more mana! Raise your max mana from the jungles between each WOMP.</li>
				<li>Flank and outmanuever the opposing team. Use the overhead structures and underpasses to get the bead on them.</li>
			</ul>
