			<h2 class="text-right text-upper"><strong>How to Play</strong></h2>

			<h3>Equip Skills</h3>

			<p>
				Prior to joining a match, you will have to select one of your reveries. This selection determines which skills will be available to you for the entire match. Upon loading in, you will then be randomly given four skills from your reverie which can be reshuffled for a potentially better starting set. 
			</p>

			<p>
				As you play, additional skills will become available. These can be used to overwrite a currently equipped skill to adapt your play style for synergizing with your allies' skills or to better combat those of the opposing team.
			</p>

			<h3>Capture Objectives</h3>

			<p>
				Each match contains three WOMPs, powerful founts of energy that any esper can tap into. The first will land at a neutral location, providing equal opportunity for both teams. The team that manages to harvest this WOMP will be that much closer to victory.
			</p>

			<p>
				Drawn to those that narrowly missed the first, the second WOMP will land closer to the currently losing team. This gives a chance to balance the odds before the third and final WOMP spawns in the center of the map. Each WOMP a team captured before the final, guarantees that one-third of the final WOMP will be automatically secured for them. 
			</p>

			<p>
				Throughout the map, additional resources can be claimed on your way to the next conflict. These remnants of fallen espers can be found in the space between each WOMP landing site. In addition, as players inevitably fall against opposing forces, one of these remnants will coalesce. Siphon the stabilizing energy to boost your maximum mana.
			</p>

			<p>
				A fusion of ancient technology and volatile energy can be found opposite from the first WOMP. Beware, this relic has drawn the attention of the local creatures and more simple-minded denizens. They must be removed from the area before you can claim the valuable restorative effects.
			</p>

			<h3>Claim Victory</h3>

			<p>
				When a team harvests the third and final WOMP, the match is over and they are victorious.
			</p>
