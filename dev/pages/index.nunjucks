					<h3>Equip Skills</h3>

					<p>
						Before joining a match, you'll select one of your reveries (decks). Choose wisely, since the reverie you pick will determine which skills are available to you for the entire match (no take-backsies). Upon entering the game, you will randomly be given four skills from your reverie which you may then reshuffle for a potentially better starting set. 
					</p>

					<p>
						As you play, you'll unlock additional skills (upgrade!). These can be used to overwrite a currently equipped skill so you can adapt your play style to synergize with your allies or better combat the opposing team.

					<h3>Harvest Resources</h3>

					<p>
						Find and collect the strange crystals strewn about the world, increasing your maximum power as a Psypher. As you kick your enemies' butts with mind-lasers and vaporize them with psychic blasts, you can collect their residual energies for your own nefarious purposes.
					</p>

					<p>
						Health shrines can be found far from the action (you gotta work for ‘em) and only give their blessing after performing the intricate ritual of… standing next to them for 10 seconds. But beware, these relics draw the attention of the local creatures and more simple-minded denizens. These heathens must be removed from the area before you can claim the shrine's valuable restorative effects.

					<h3>Claim Victory</h3>

					<p>
						The main objective of Eidetus is to capture the massive sources of energy called WOMPs (named by the locals for the, er, pleasant sound they make upon contact with the ground) before the opposing Psypher team does. Every captured WOMP leading up to the final one improves your chance to win the battle with huge gains in mana and lower capture time. 
					</p>

					<p>
						There are 6 randomized WOMP spawn locations around the battlefield, with the last WOMP landing dead-center in the middle of it all for the no-holds-barred finale, where the winning team takes all!

			<ul>
				<li>Combo those skills. One-offs are great, but a series of follow-ups will really turn the tide of a fight.</li>
				<li>Keep those trigger fingers twitch'n. Get a shot in before they can react, but make sure to raise that defense to block incoming attacks too.</li>
				<li>WOMPs capture faster with teammates. Stick together and that objective is practically yours.</li>
				<li>Skills need mana. Stronger skills need even more mana! Raise your max mana from the jungles between each WOMP.</li>
				<li>Flank and outmanuever the opposing team. Use the overhead structures and underpasses to get the bead on them.</li>
